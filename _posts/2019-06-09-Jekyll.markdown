It may be better to follow github guide on setting github pages with Jekyll. It may change in future and following code may not be up to date.

Install ruby using snap since it is latest there as compared to apt. However it may not be safe.

```
sudo snap install ruby --classic
```

Install the bundler gem

```
gem install bundler
```

Create a `Gemfile` with following code

```
source 'https://rubygems.org'
gem 'github-pages', group: :jekyll_plugins
```

Run following to install all depenedecies as per Gemfile:

```
bundle install
```

This is not working on ubuntu 19.04, as of Jun 2019. As per solution pasted here:


[https://github.com/eventmachine/eventmachine/issues/881](https://github.com/eventmachine/eventmachine/issues/881)


We try to install ruby with RVM (ruby version manager)

First instll gnupg2 and curl
```
sudo apt install gnupg2
sudo apt install curl
```

Get key from here: [https://rvm.io/](https://rvm.io/])

Install ruby + rails, feels like overkill to just build one static site (?)

```
gpg2 --recv-keys 409B6B1796C275462A1703113804BB82D39DC0E3 7D2BAF1CF37B13E2069D6956105BD0E739499BDB
\curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --rails
```

To use ruby add following:
```
source /home/luffy/.rvm/scripts/rvm
```

Create a new site:
```
bundle exec jekyll _3.3.0_ new web
```

In Gemfile change following: comment gem jekyll line and uncomment github line

You might have to delete local gem lock file as it may contains old gem that might not be compatibles. 

To run the site locally:
```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Jul 2021: ruby 3.0 is not supported by github pages so downgrade to 2.7

```
rvm install ruby-2.7

```
